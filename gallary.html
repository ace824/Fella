                    I chose these photos because I like sunsets and I enjoy watching them after a long day, I feel like they're relaxing to watch. I wanted to put myself in the sunset image to represent that Im the sun and that im shining bright. I combined two images. My sources of inspiration is that I like to take pictures of the sky, especially sunsets and I like to take a lot of selfies of myself. The most challenging part of the project was to edit the image size and to blend in the colors, I solved my problem by asking a classmate to show me the instructions.

                    In this selfie photo I wanted to chose a darkish and light background because I like shades mix in a photo, I think it makes it stand out. They represent me because I like the different colors and I feel like they look nice on me. My sources of inspiration comes from different colors from other photos I previous took and wanted to make this idea work. The most challenging part was to covert the photo from a download file to a zip file.

                    I wanted to create a Haunted House with evil spirits sounds and different sound effects. Then a little girl hears scary sounds and calls for her parents, she screams with fright and fear and evil laughs are being heard, after she had screamed laughs are being heard. I had combined and used 5 audio files, for the effects I used used a evil growl and a scream from Freesounds.com. The most challenging part for me was to trim and move around the different sound effects so it could make sense within the audio sound. I solved it by asking for help with classmates and watching Youtube tutorials.
