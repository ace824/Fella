                    I chose these photos because I like sunsets and I enjoy watching them after a long day, I feel like they're relaxing to watch. I wanted to put myself in the sunset image to represent that Im the sun and that im shining bright. I combined two images. My sources of inspiration is that I like to take pictures of the sky, especially sunsets and I like to take a lot of selfies of myself. The most challenging part of the project was to edit the image size and to blend in the colors, I solved my problem by asking a classmate to show me the instructions.

                    In this selfie photo I wanted to chose a darkish and light background because I like shades mix in a photo, I think it makes it stand out. They represent me because I like the different colors and I feel like they look nice on me. My sources of inspiration comes from different colors from other photos I previous took and wanted to make this idea work. The most challenging part was to covert the photo from a download file to a zip file.

                    I wanted to create a Haunted House with evil spirits sounds and different sound effects. Then a little girl hears scary sounds and calls for her parents, she screams with fright and fear and evil laughs are being heard, after she had screamed laughs are being heard. I had combined and used 5 audio files, for the effects I used used a evil growl and a scream from Freesounds.com. The most challenging part for me was to trim and move around the different sound effects so it could make sense within the audio sound. I solved it by asking for help with classmates and watching Youtube tutorials.

                 The type of emotion I decided to animate is a relaxing tone. I chose these colors/shapes because I wanted to view the different types of color sequences that are related to a relaxing afternoon day . I approach my timing by brainstorming different ideas and making sure everything is right. The most challenging part was to merge all the different shapes to making individual clouds., I resolved it by using Adobe tutorials on youtube.

                 I decided to animate a Basketball dribbling up and down within an empty Basketball arena to give it a narrow view. I chose these images because personally, Basketball is my favorite sport to watch and play and also to give it a 3D look.  I approached my work artistically because I wanted to create a unique style for my gif animation. The most challenging part

                Description: The type of social cause I'm promoting is COVID-19 (Coronavirus). I'm promoting it because it made a massive effect this year in the world, a lot of things have changed because of the spread of the virus. The type of media I chose was Animation because I wanted to show different varieties in a short 1 minute 30 frame video to give a summary of the explanation of the virus. It would be the best choice to convey my message, to show and give an example of the Do's and don'ts when protecting yourself in a straight forward fashion. The different images/colors/sounds I chose for this relates to this matter by showing and hearing a soft song about COVID-19 explaining that you showed stay home so you won't get sick or others as well. For the photos, I wanted to give animated sight of summary wit bright colors to show happiness during a horrible pandemic this is.
