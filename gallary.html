                    I chose these photos because I like sunsets and I enjoy watching them after a long day, I feel like they're relaxing to watch. I wanted to put myself in the sunset image to represent that Im the sun and that im shining bright. I combined two images. My sources of inspiration is that I like to take pictures of the sky, especially sunsets and I like to take a lot of selfies of myself. The most challenging part of the project was to edit the image size and to blend in the colors, I solved my problem by asking a classmate to show me the instructions.
